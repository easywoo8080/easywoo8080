👋 Hi, I’m @easywoo8080  
👀 I’m interested in building real-time monitoring systems for wastewater treatment plants, algorithm problem solving, and cross-platform game development.  
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced PostgreSQL (PL/pgSQL), Python regression analysis, and frontend/backend integration for real-time data systems.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving time-synchronized sensor data, efficient data pipelines, and creative coding for web/mobile apps.  
📫 How to reach me: easywoo8080@gmail.com  
😄 Pronouns: he/him  
⚡ Fun fact: I design systems that talk to real-world instruments—and sometimes beat them in speed!
